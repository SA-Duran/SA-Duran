## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Samuel DurÃ¡n

I'm an applied mathematician and engineer with a strong interest in scientific machine learning and inverse problems.

ðŸ“š My background combines chemical engineering and an MSc in applied mathematics (CIMAT), where Iâ€™ve explored physics-informed neural networks, probabilistic modeling, and PDE-based simulation. 

ðŸ§  Iâ€™m especially drawn to research-oriented projects that merge theory with real-world applications in energy, environment, and AI for science.

ðŸ”‹ My latest work is at the intersection of electrochemistry and data, using physical models and Gaussian processes to understand lithium-ion battery behavior.   


Currently building open, structured projects in deep learning, natural language processing, and reinforcement learning.
